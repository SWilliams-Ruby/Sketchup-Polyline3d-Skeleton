# sketchup-polyline3d-skeleton

SW::Skeleton, an extension to convert all of the edges in a selected group or cpmponent into their equivalent sketchup polyline3d objects which will be ignored by Sketchup inferencing algorithm(s). A side effect is that after this conversion the user can no longer easily apply a material to the group with the paint bucket. To remedy this problem select the skeletonized group or component in the outlliner or via a left to right select of the entire group.

Usage :
 - select a group or component
 - in the (right click) context menu choose Create Skeleton
 - to change the material, select the skeleton and in the (right clkick) context menu choose Paint Skeleton
